# ReaMOD Extension for REAPER

ReaMOD is an extension for [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/), a digital audio workstation, that integrates FMOD Studio projects into REAPER. It allows users to trigger FMOD events and snapshots directly within REAPER, providing a seamless workflow for game audio development and other interactive audio applications.

I recorded a quick [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/mngoJSFgblk) showing the basic workflow/concepts of ReaMOD. For some reason, OBS captured the audio from Reaper twice so all the playback examples sound off. Sorry! Someday I'll produce a better quality demo video.

## Installation Instructions

ReaMOD is a REAPER extension that integrates FMOD functionality. Due to FMOD licensing, you must supply your own FMOD API libraries.

### Install Dependencies

Before installing ReaMOD be sure that you have already installed both the SWS/S&M and ReaImGui extension. They can be installed via the ReaPack Pack Manager for Reaper.

1. Download and follow the installation instruction for ReaPack: [https://reapack.com/](https://reapack.com/)

Note: Users of macOS Catalina or newer may need to click on "Allow Anyway" in System Preferences > Security & Privacy after launching REAPER once for ReaPack to load when installed for the first time. Restart REAPER after approving.

2. Once ReaPack is installed, open it from the menu bar Extensions > ReaPack > Browse Packages... and install the following extensions:
    - SWS/S&M extensions
    - ReaImGui: ReaScript binding for Dear ImGui

### Installing ReaMOD

1) Locate your REAPER resource folder
   In REAPER: Options → “Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder”.
   This opens the root directory where REAPER expects extensions.

2) Copy the extension file for your operating system into the UserPlugins subfolder:

     - macOS   → REAPER/UserPlugins/reaper_ReaMOD_Plugin.dylib
     - Windows → REAPER/UserPlugins/reaper_ReaMOD_Plugin.dll

3) Copy the ReaMOD folder into the top level of the REAPER resources folder.
    
    This folder contains the FMOD API files ReaMOD needs to be able to communicate with FMOD.

     - macOS   → REAPER/ReaMOD
     - Windows → REAPER/ReaMOD

    Example macOS-oriented layout (Windows users typically put DLLs next to REAPER.exe, not here):
        ```
         REAPER/
         ├─ UserPlugins/
         │  └─ reaper_ReaMOD_Plugin.(dylib|dll)
         └─ ReaMOD/
            └─ fmod/
               ├─ core/
               │  └─ lib/
               │     └─ libfmod.dylib              (macOS)
               └─ studio/
                  └─ lib/
                     └─ libfmodstudio.dylib        (macOS)
        ```


4) Copy the ReaMOD JSFX to the Effects folder in REAPER's Resource directory.

5) Restart REAPER

   After copying everything into place, restart REAPER.
   If installed correctly all the ReaMOD actions should appear in REAPER's actions list.

Notes
-----
- macOS Gatekeeper: if macOS blocks the dylib, open System Settings → Privacy & Security and “Allow Anyway”, then restart REAPER. If needed:
    `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "REAPER/UserPlugins/reaper_ReaMOD_Plugin.dylib"`
- Architecture: use 64-bit REAPER with 64-bit FMOD (Windows x64; macOS universal is supported).
- Debug FMOD libs (libfmodL.*, fmodL.*) are for development; end users should use the non-L variants.



## Usage

Note to Windows users: ASIO audio drivers have been reported to NOT work with ReaMOD since only one app can control the driver at a time and ReaMOD relies on audio to be able run in the background. 

### Opening the ReaMOD Window

- After installing ReaMOD, you can open the ReaMOD window by running the custom action:

  ```
  ReaMOD: Open/Close Window
  ```

- You can assign this action to a keyboard shortcut or add it to a toolbar for quick access.

### Loading an FMOD Project

1. **Select FMOD Project**

   - In the ReaMOD window, click the `Select` button to choose an `.fspro` FMOD Studio project file.

2. **Manage Bank Directories**

   - After selecting the project, by default ReaMOD will find and list the any available `.bank` files in the project's `Build/Desktop` directory and load the `Master.bank`.
   - The list of bank directories can be managed with the `Add directory...` or `Remove` directory buttons.

3. **Managing Banks**
   - Use the `Load`/`Unload` buttons next to each bank to load/unload them .
   - Press the `Rescan` button to update the `.bank` files after making any changes in FMOD Studio.

### Browsing and Playing Events

- The loaded banks will display the available FMOD events and snapshots.
- Click the play button next to an event to audition it.
- Click on an event's name to select it. The selected event's parameters will be displayed in the `Selected Event` section.

### Adjusting Parameters

- In the `Selected Event` section, use the sliders to adjust the event's parameters.
- If the event is currently playing, changes to the sliders will affect the event in real-time.

### Inserting FMOD Events

- Use the provided custom actions to insert media items to trigger specific FMOD event:

  - **Add Item with selected event at edit cursor**: Inserts an empty media item at the edit cursor on the selected track with the selected FMOD event and the current value of any associated FMOD parameters in the item's notes.
  - **Add Item with selected event within current time selection**: Inserts an empty media item spanning the time selection with the selected event and the current value of any associated FMOD parameters in the item's notes.
  - **Add item with selected event length at edit cursor**: Inserts an empty media item with the same length as the selected FMOD event and the current value of any associated FMOD parameters in the item's notes.

- These actions can be assigned to keyboard shortcuts or added to toolbars.

### Playback Integration

- The ReaMOD window must be open for FMOD events to be triggered.
- When you play back your REAPER project, ReaMOD will automatically check all tracks for FMOD-related media items. It looks for tracks whose names contain ‘FMOD’ or ‘fmod,’ as well as any tracks inside a parent folder whose name contains ‘FMOD’ or ‘fmod.’
- Adjust the `Event detection lookahead time (ms)` in ReaMOD's setting to accomadate any latency issues. Note that timing is a little "loose" in ReaMOD due to several factors that may not be possible to solve.

### Custom Actions

ReaMOD provides several custom actions for enhanced workflow:

- **ReaMOD: Open/Close Window**
    Open or close the ReaMOD window.
- **ReaMOD: Add Item with selected event at edit cursor**
    Adds the currently selected FMOD event in the ReaMOD window with the current parameter values (as item notes) to the selected track at the edit cursor position for the number of frames set in ReaMOD settings.
- **ReaMOD: Add item with selected event length at edit cursor**
    Adds the currently selected FMOD event at the edit cursor and automatically sizes the new item to match the FMOD event's reported length, falling back to the frame-count length when unavailable.
- **ReaMOD: Add Item with selected event within current time selection**
    Adds the currently selected FMOD event in the ReaMOD window with the current parameter values (as item notes) to the selected track at the edit cursor position within the current time selection.
- **ReaMOD: Update number of frames for item insertion from current time selection**
    Updates the "Number of frames for inserted item" value in ReaMOD's settings based upon the currrent time selection made in Reaper.
- **ReaMOD: Stop/Release All FMOD Event Instances**
    Stops and releases all active FMOD event instances.
- **ReaMOD: Insert default parameter update item for selected event item on selected track at edit cursor**
    Inserts an empty media item with the currently selected media item's GUID identifier in its item notes and the defualt item name `param:Name=Value` for use so the user can replace `Name` and `Value` with the desired parameter and value they want to changed for the targeted media item and it corisponding FMOD event.
- **ReaMOD: Insert parameter automation items for selected event item over time selection**
    Current solution for changing FMOD parameters over time. Requires a time selection and a media item to be selected before running the action. After running the action the user is prompted to enter the `parameter name` of the desired FMOD parameter, a `starting value`, and an `ending value`. The action then inserts one media item per frame and interpolates over every frame within the time selection between the starting and ending values provided.
- **ReaMOD: Insert position interpolation items for selected media item over time selection**
    Current solution for controlling FMOD events 3D location. Requires a time selection and a media item to be selected before running the action. The selected media item should be the one used to triggered the 3D FMOD event that the users wants to control. After running the action the user is prompted to enter the starting and ending location (`x`, `y`, and `z`). The action then inserts one media item per frame and interpolates over every frame within the time selection between the starting and ending locations provided.

Assign these actions to keyboard shortcuts or add them to toolbars for quick access.

### Settings

- **Look Ahead Time**: Adjust the look-ahead time (in milliseconds) for event detection.
- **Number of Frames for Item**: Set the number of frames to use when inserting items.
- **Move Edit Cursor After Insert**: Toggle whether the edit cursor moves to the end of the inserted item.
- **Update Item Length from Time Selection**: When inserting items within the time selection, update the item length based on the time selection.

## Recording/Exporting Audio with ReaMOD
All the audio triggered by ReaMOD does not actually flow through Reaper so there are only two options for capturing the audio stream triggered by ReaMOD:
1. Use the "Live Update" feature of FMOD Studio to connect to ReaMOD and then record a new session in FMOD Studio's Profiler window.
2. Use a screen recording software like OBS to record your system audio.  

## Notes

- **Track Naming**: ReaMOD monitors tracks named "FMOD" (case-insensitive) for triggering events based on items.
- **Parameter Automation**: You can automate FMOD event parameters using items and take names starting with `param:`.
